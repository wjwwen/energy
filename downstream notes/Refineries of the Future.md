# Feedstock Basics
## Major factors: 
- Density/API gravity (measure of density)
- Sulfur content (1-4%)
- Distillation

## Minor factors:
- Acid Number (TAN)
- Gasoline Octane
- PONA
- Kerosene smoke point
- Diesel Cetane
- Residuum Asphaltenes

## Crude oil contains primarily carbon & hydrogen atoms, impurities include sulfur, nitrogen, metals
- Refinery processing schemes based on boiling ranges; largely defined by molercular weight 
<br>
(PONA) 
- Paraffins
- Olefins
- Aromatics
- Iso-Paraffins
- Naphthenes

- Pour point: how viscous the liquid is; critical for specific products like diesel and lubricants

# Refinery Technology
## Separation, Conversion, Treating
**1. Separation**
- Crude oil distillation
- Vacuum distillation 

**2. Conversion (yield change)**
- Fluid catalytic cracking hydrocracking (FCC)
- Coking & thermal cracking

**3. Treating (quality improvement)**
- Reforming
- Isomerisation
- Hydrotreating (removal of sulfur)
- Desulfurisation
- Alkylation

## Key Messages
1. Refinery configuration and feedstock choice are the main determinants of yields
2. Process units can be operated in different modes to shift yields
3. Refineries can be modified over time, but is often capital intensive

HCUs - distillates <br>
FCC - gasoline <br>
RFCC - common in Asia owing to the light crude <br> 

# Refinery Margins
- EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation)
- Net Cash Margin = EBITDA

- Product Yields > Gross Revenue > Gross Margin > Variable Margin > Net Cash Margin
- Feedstock/variable/fixed costs
- Ultimately, net cash margin is crucial for long-term investment and variable margin is important for the short-term

| Variable                              | Fixed |
| -----------                           | ----------- |
| electricity, purchased fuel, water    | labor, taxes, maintenance                             |

- 70-75% is fuel cost
- Crude sold as a FOB basis most of the time
- Crude goes direct into refinery and not storage

# Complexity increases, refining margin increases
(But you may not pursue this case if the margins is not high enough)
- Topping > Hydroskimming > Cracking > Coking 
- Crude distillation > Sulfur Removal, Octane Enhancement > VGO Conversion > Vacuum Resid Conversion

- Location of a refinery matters

# Feedstock Optimization
- Equipment + processes
- LP model to find crude and corresponding product slate
- Effective energy management + oil loss management

# Energy Transition: Fundamentals
## Emissions have continued despite increased talk of an energy transition
- Accelerating energy transition
- Oil demand concentrated in transportation sectors
(penetration of alternative fuels have been very limited)

## A range of carbon-abating options emerging
1. Improved operational efficiency
2. Better fuel economy
3. New propulsion systems (EVs)
4. New fuels
5. Offsetting

## Policy v.s. Technology
- Technology-forcing policy (e.g. biofuels mandate by the government to resolve 
the decarbonisation problem)
- Technology-agnostic policy (e.g. big picture, setting a carbon reduction target)

## Dominant and emerging pathways in transportation
- Battery electric, hydrogen fuel cell, biofuels, efuels, other low CI fuels
- **Electrofuels**, also known as e-fuels or synthetic fuels. <br>
They are manufactured using captured carbon dioxide or carbon monoxide, together with hydrogen obtained from sustainable 
electricity sources such as wind, solar and nuclear power.
- Low carbon intensive fuels - LNG, ammonia, methanol produced using blue/green hydrogen

## By **2026**, IHSM expects BEVs to be cost-competitive with ICEs

## Downstream transformation
- Refiners integrating blue/green hydrogen, CCS and renwable power to reduce emissions

1. Reducing emissions from the **asset**
2. Reducing **carbon intensity of the output** from the refinery

> Capital allocation challenges as the refineries of the future becomes more integrated

# Outlook for Refined Products as Petrochemical Feedstocks
### Olefins
> More than 95%: Ethane, Propane, Butane (EPB)
- Naphtha demand increases through 2050 

### Aromatics
- More reformate (heavy naphtha) required to meet aromatics demand, but its share is
likely to decline with increasing alternative sources
- Small share of MTO/CTO (2.5 MMt/25MMt)
- Associated gas has more liquids (Naphtha/EPB), growing
- Non-associated gas less growth and the share for LPG will decline through 2050
(supply-driven as gas is the focus, byproduct not the focus)

> ### Nonassociated gas
Developed primarily to produce natural gas. There may or may not be condensate production together with the gas. Under these conditions, it is essential that there be a profitable market to which to deliver the gas.

> ### Associated gas
Produced as a byproduct of the production of crude oil. Associated gas reserves are typically developed for the production of crude oil, which pays for the field development costs. The reserves typically produce at peak levels for a few years and then decline.

### Refinery important source for Naphtha and LPG
- 85% of naphtha produced from refining; 15% from other sources i.e. gas processing (NGL)
- Nonassociated gas reserves are developed primarily to produce natural gas.

# Grassroots COTC Developments and Trends
- COTC 4-5x higher production than worldscale plants
- LSWR - low sulfur waxy residue
- LSWR is a low sulfur resid produced primarily in Indonesia and used as a conversion feedstock and fuel oil blend stock across Asia.

### World Cost Curve
- Cost basis = plant gate
- Product basis 
- Operating rate basis = IHS baseline

## Refinery Flexibility for Higher Petrochemical Production
- Aromatics: benzene/toluene/xylene
- Olefins: ethylene/propylene

- Light naphtha > isomerization > gasoline 
- Heavy naphtha > reforming > gasoline

# Refinery Flexibility Bioconversions
- Blending: Ethanol, FAME, Renewable Diesel/HVO, SAF
- FAME: fatty acid methyl ester
- HVO = hydrogenated vegetable oils
- Biorefinery conversions
- Process basics - hydroprocessing of esters and fatty acids (HEFA)
- Capacity depends on the current hydrocracker/hydrotreating capacity...
Converted plants remain an order of magnitude smaller than the original refinery

## Conversions and co-processing add 8.5 MMt HVO capacity 2020 v.s. 2025
### Growth driven by legislation for low-carbon road fuels

### Carbon intensity scores for selected feedstocks
- https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/resources/documents/lcfs-pathway-certified-carbon-intensities
- CARB diesel, used cooking oil, forest residue, fish fat, technical corn oil, animal fat
- Traditional diesel 104 gCO2/MJ

# Electricity and hydrogen are major inputs and sources of emissions for refiners
What does gco2 stand for? <br>
The units 'gCO2eq/kWh' are grams of carbon dioxide equivalent per kilowatt-hour of electricity generated. Carbon dioxide is the most significant GHG and is produced, for example, when fossil fuels are burnt. GHGs other than carbon dioxide, such as methane, are quantified as equivalent amounts of carbon dioxide.

### Wind and solar are set to play a bigger role across scenarios
- Inflections
- Green Rules
- Discord
- ACCS (Accelerated CCS)
- MTM (Multitech Mitigation)

### Hydrogen is incredibly expensive to produce; in order to be green, it must be scaled up

### Electrolysis capacity growing (Hydrogen production)
- As of June 2022, global electrolysis pipeline is est. at 400 GWe

### Hydrogen colors
- Gray
- Blue
- Green
- Pink
- Turqoise 
- Yellow/Purple

### Notes
- Refiners are primary users and producers of Hydrogen...
- Blue (Steam Methane Reformation) v.s. Green (Electrolysis)

> Hydrogen use in the refinery of the future is set to increase

# **Carbon Scopes**
### Scope 1
- Onsite fuel use
- Venting and flaring
- Fugitives

### Scope 2
- Energy trade
- Project G&A

### Scope 3 (Hard to track)
- Refined product use
- Downstream processing
- Upstream fuel production

### Lifecycle GHG of petroleum fuels
- Well to tank: 20-30%
- Combustion (refined products): 70-80%

### Units
Unit of volume: bbl
Unit of energy: MJ

### Typical refinery emission
- 300 kbd refinery ~ 5 MMt/year of carbon emissions
- Emissions depends on heavy/light crude + refinery configuration
- *** CO2 emissions derived from emission factors based on type of equipment, the amount and quality of fuel fired 

### Influencing Carbon Emissions
1. Oil Quality
- Density
- Sulfur content
2. Refinery complexity
- Energy consumption during processing

## The Trajectory to Net-Zero
### Sources of carbon emissions
- Venting
- Fuel fired in process heaters
- Fuel fired in steam generators
- Hydrogen manufacture
- Electricity generaiton

### Strategy 1: Energy Efficiency
- Energy efficiency (e.g. operating equipment at best efficiency points, maximising hydrogen recovery)
- Reduce emissions by 5-10%

### Strategy 2: Change equipment
- Biggest contributor is hydrogen reformer, which if shifted to natural gas, the reduction is startling

### Strategy 3: CCUS
- Replace hydrogen from SMR by green hydrogen
- Replace electricity by renewables
- CCUS
